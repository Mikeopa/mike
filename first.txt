VERIFY THE INTEGRITY OF THE FILES
It is essential that you verify the integrity of the downloaded file using the PGP signature (.asc file) or a hash (.md5 or .sha* file). Please read Verifying Apache Software Foundation Releases for more information on why you should verify our releases.

The PGP signature can be verified using PGP or GPG. First download the KEYS as well as the asc signature file for the relevant distribution.

% gpg --import KEYS
% gpg --verify downloaded_file.asc downloaded_file
or

% pgpk -a KEYS
% pgpv downloaded_file.asc
or

% pgp -ka KEYS
% pgp downloaded_file.asc
